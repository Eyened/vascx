# VascX retinal analysis pipeline

Repository for future deployment of the vascx retinal analysis pipeline. We will make available the building blocks of our pipeline here as we publish them.

## VascX models
VascX models for vessels, artery-vein, disc segmentation and fovea localisation have been released. Instructions are in rtnls [rtnls-vascx-models](https://github.com/Eyened/rtnls_vascx_models).
